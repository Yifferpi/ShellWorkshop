Inside the task1 folder there is a typical user file from a linux system. Write a command that:
- Lists all the users on the system in alphabetical order
- Prints the number of users on the system

Task 2
============================================
Inside the task2 folder, print all the lines from the documents
that dont start with #

Ideas
============================================
- take the contents of 10 files and put it in one file
- print the first line from the 3 biggest files in the folder 
- Use the tr command to translate or delete characters from a file. For example, you could use the command tr -d '[:digit:]' < file.txt to delete all digits from a file.
    - use it to filter certain charset out of a file
- use rsync to merge two directory structures
- use diff to find message in delta of two files
